# Requirement Analysis in Software Development.
## Project Description
The Requirement Analysis Project focuses on crafting a comprehensive foundation for software development by documenting, analyzing, and structuring requirements. It aims at creating a blueprint of the requirement analysis phase for a booking management system. This project simulates a real-world development scenario, emphasizing clarity, precision, and structure in defining requirements to set the stage for successful project execution.
### Learning Objective
The objective of this project is to enhance a professional developer’s ability to:
- Master the principles and methodologies of Requirement Analysis in the software development lifecycle (SDLC).
- Efficiently translate project needs into structured documentation.
- Identify and categorize functional and non-functional requirements for scalable systems.
- Leverage tools like Draw.io for visual representation of system requirements.
- Establish clear acceptance criteria to ensure alignment with business and user goals.
- Apply best practices to produce industry-standard documentation and diagrams.
## What is Requirement Analysis?
Requirement Analysis is the process of identifying, gathering, documenting, and analyzing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. It ensures that the development team clearly understands what is to be built, why it is needed, and how it should function.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?
Requirement Analysis plays a foundational role in the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). Its importance can be summarized as follows:

1. Defines Project Scope
Clearly identifies what the software should and should not do.
Prevents scope creep by establishing boundaries early on.
2. Bridges Stakeholders and Developers
Translates business needs into technical specifications.
Ensures developers understand the business context, not just the code.
3. Reduces Risks and Costs
Detects potential issues early in the process.
Fixing errors during requirement analysis is significantly cheaper than fixing them during coding or after deployment.
4. Improves Product Quality
Aligns the final product with user needs and business goals.
Leads to better user satisfaction through usability-focused requirements.
5. Guides Design and Development
Serves as a blueprint for the design, architecture, and coding stages.
Provides measurable acceptance criteria that define “done.”
6. Supports Testing and Validation
Requirements act as the foundation for test case creation.
Ensures that every feature developed can be tested against documented expectations.
7. Facilitates Communication
Provides a single reference point for stakeholders, project managers, and developers.
Minimizes misunderstandings and misaligned expectations.

## Key Activities in Requirement Analysis
- Requirement Gathering: Collecting input from clients, users, and stakeholders.
- Requirement Documentation: Structuring requirements into understandable formats (e.g., Software Requirement Specification (SRS)).
- Requirement Validation: Ensuring requirements are correct, complete, feasible, and aligned with business goals.
- Requirement Elicitation: The process of gathering requirements from stakeholders through techniques like interviews, surveys, and observation.
- Requirement Validation: The process of ensuring that gathered requirements are accurate, complete, feasible, and aligned with business goals.
## Types of Requirements
There are two requirements for booking management project and they ae: 
### Functional Requirements 
### Non-functional Requirements
## Use Case Diagrams
***Use Case Diagrams*** are visual representations in UML (Unified Modeling Language) that show the interactions between actors (users or external systems) and a system to achieve specific goals (use cases). They focus on what the system should do rather than how it is implemented.

### Benefits of Use Case Diagrams
- Clarity: Provide a simple, high-level view of system functionality.
- Communication: Bridge the gap between technical teams and non-technical stakeholders.
- Requirement Capture: Help identify functional requirements and system boundaries.
- Prioritization: Make it easier to see which features are most critical to users.
- Documentation: Serve as part of the requirement specification for future reference.
- Validation: Ensure that all user interactions and goals are considered during analysis.
